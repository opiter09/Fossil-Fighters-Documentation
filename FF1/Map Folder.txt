EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

The Map folder is split into five sub-folders:
	- c's use is unknown, but speculated to involve the Camera
	- e sets out the various Excavation zones in each digsite
	- g's use is unknown
	- m defines various parameters for the map, along with saying which vivosaurs can be found in each numbered zone
	- r contains all NPCs, loading zones, etc.

Within them, all files are numbered, according to map ID. In this folder is a file named Map IDs.txt, which shows you which maps are which (thanks to Megalo-Vania for
documenting that).

All the folders except m are of the type GRD, i.e. "grid." Thus, if you remove the first 20 bytes of the file, then set HxD to display a number of bytes per row equal to
bytes 4-8, you end up with a picture of the map telling you where everything is. For excavation, specifically, FF1-E-Maps-Color.zip in this folder shows renditions of that
made using Python.

M is a little different, and its full purpose has not yet been divined. However, for fossils specifically, the following set-up is known:
- At 0x54 to 0x57, there is a pointer
- At that pointer, there is a list of pointers, the number of which can be found at 0x50-0x53
- Each of that list goes to a fossil table. All information about it will be given in relative addresses:
	- The zone the table is for is at 0x04; if you see the same zone multiple times, that is for when it changes during the course of the story, due to Fossil Chips
	  (see below) or other undetermined factors
	- 0x08 is a value relating to what sonar upgrades you need for these to show up. 0x6F is nothing, and 0x71 is two fossil chips; ergo, we can assmue 0x70 is one chip.
	  Some tables (mainly Pay to Dig sites) have a weird value in here, whose purpose is unknown.
	- 0x0C-0x10 is the maximum number of spawns of this zone that can occur in this map
	- The number of vivosaur entries is given at 0x28-0x2B. This also serves as the number of pointers coming up (all of which are relative to the beginning of this
      particular fossil table)
	- Because there can be unknown data between here and the pointers, the location of the beginning of those pointers can be found at 0x2C-0x2F
	- Heading there, each pointer is four bytes. As far as I can tell, however, all vivosaur entries seem to be 32 bytes long, so why
      there are pointers for it is unknown
	- After that, we finally get the vivosaur entries. For each entry, the first four bytes is the vivosaur ID, then the next four are the chance
      of the spawn being that entry. After that are eight unknown bytes, then 16 bytes representing the chance of each individual part spawning once the vivo is
	  decided--four for Head, Body, Arms, and Legs

If you find all that confusing, not to fear. There is a file named "FF1 Digsites" in this folder that dumps all that data from every digsite. Additionally, the
Python source code is provided, if that helps you understand it better.
