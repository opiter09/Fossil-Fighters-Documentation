EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

FF1 contains a folder named "battle." Within this folder is a variety of small files, each given the
cryptic name of simply a number. However, I was able to ascertain that these files actually store the
definition for the teams of the various NPCs, and from there I have been working out many things about
the files. Also, to be clear, these files do need to be decompressed and recompressed, despite their
small size.

If you would just like to see all of that information, I have made a human-readable collection of it in the
form of the file "Battle Files Teams.txt." I have also included the python script I used to generate it,
namely ff1_teamsOutput.py. However, if you would like to actually edit that file, here is what I found:


0x54-0x57 represent the BP you get for winning the fight (as, per usual, a 4-byte little-endian integer).
If this value is FF FF FF FF, e.g. for Captain Travers, you will get no BP at all at the end.

0x64-0x65 are the name of the fighter in question. This value corresponds to a certain chunk in
text/japanese; if you split it apart with my editor, you can simply look for the file whose name begins
with this number in textFiles.

The vivosaurs start at 0x94. We get four bytes of ID, then four bytes of Level, and then four bytes that are
always 00 00 00 00. If there are less than three vivosaurs on the team, their bytes simply do not exist, and
we skip on to the next bit.

After the vivosaur/level data is four bytes per vivosaur which represent how many level points (is that
what they're called?) the vivosaur has. The reason this is a thing is to control their exact LP.
Then we have another set of four bytes per vivosaur, which are completely unknown to me, other than that
00 08 00 00 shows up a lot here.

Finally, after 8-24 bytes, we get to the number of moves. These are, again, four per vivosaur on the team.
You know you're here when you get one to three four-byte integers in a row that are between 1 and 4.

After that, we get eight useless bytes, which are the always same four bytes repeated twice for some reason.


This is all well and good if you just want to change a vivosaur, but what if you want to add or remove the
total number of them? Well, that involves an entire process:
- Change the number of vivosaurs values at 0x5C, 0x6C, 0x74, and 0x7C
- Change the unknown values at 0x70, 0x78, 0x80, and 0x88 to the right ones for how many vivosaurs you
want:
	- One: 44, 48, 4C, 50
	- Two: 50, 58, 60, 68
	- Three: 5C, 68, 74, 80
- Add or remove data where it needs to be, as described above. The only advice I can give regarding
the unknown values is that making one vivo have 00 08 00 00 and the others all 00's or
vice versa will make that one always start in the AZ. Honestly though, all 00's should always
work fine
- Finally, change the values at 0x38 and 0x40 to match the new file size
