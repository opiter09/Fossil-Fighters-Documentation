EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

For whatever reason, vivosaur chunks have 12 extra bytes of padding at the beginning compared to FFC: two for
their ID, then literally just ten 00's.

Right after that, at 0x0C, is a vivosaur's length in meters (rounded). This does not seem to do anything,
and changing it will not change the Fossil Museum text.

At 0x0D is a vivosaur's Element. 01 is Fire, 02 is Air, 03 is Earth, 04 is Water, 05 is Neutral, and
06 is Legendary.

At 0x0E-0x0F is the vivosaur's Rank 12 Health divided by 2. It has been suggested that this is used for
U-Raptor's "ultimate poison" skill. Make sure to change this if you change the value it's based on.

For the main four stats, each gets four bytes starting at 0x10. The first byte is some sort of growth rate,
seemingly always from 01 to 04. Then we have the Rank 8 value, then the Rank 1 value, and then the Rank
12 value. The order is the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy, and Evasion.

A vivosaur's crit can be found at 0x20 and 0x21. For reasons unknown, it is always the same value twice in
a row.

A vivosaur's Link Chance can be found at 0x22. Making something have or not have Link is as simple as making
this 0 or not 0, nothing else needs to be done.

The team compatibility of a vivosaur can be found from 0x24 to 0x27. It is stored not in hex, but in
binary, with each 1 of this 32-bit integer denoting a team it is in, and each 0 denoting a team it is
not in. When converting, do not swap the bytes around or anything, type them in exactly as you see them
(i.e. big-endian), and also remember to add zeroes at the beginning of the result if the first byte(s) are
00 (since programs usually leave those off). Here is the table for groups (it's very long, feel free to
skip over it):
1: Group 8
2: Group 7
3: Group 6 (Violent)
4: Group 5 (Neutral-types)
5: Group 4 (Water-Types)
6: Group 3 (Earth-Types)
7: Group 2 (Air-Types)
8: Group 1 (Fire-Types)
9: Group 16 (Japanese)
10: Group 15
11: Group 14
12: Group 13
13: Group 12
14: Group 11
15: Group 10
16: Group 9
[each pre-colon number is in decimal, and is which bit from the left controls that group]

Note: these Groups come from the Wiki. See
https://fossilfighters.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Compatible_Vivosaurs for more information.

Also note that in FF1, only these 16 groups are used, and so the last two bytes are always 00 00. Feel free
to use the other ones though, there's no reason they would not work.

0x30 to 0x33 is the ID for the team skill of the vivosaur. An important difference to note here between FF1
and FFC is that FF1 uses four bytes for skill IDs (with the last two always being 00 00), while FFC only uses two.

0x34 to 0x37 is the skill used for Link. Unlike in FFC, animations are still played for Link triggers in FF1,
so this has the potential to cause some unusual results depending on what move you use.

0x61 represents a vivosaur's passive "Ability" ID (the blue skill in FFC). The table for that is shown
below, with names taken from FFC:
- 01: Nothing
- 02: Japanese for "View enemy details during battle"
- 03: Japanese for "Dinosaur placement randomization"
- 04: FP Plus
- 05: Parting Blow
- 06: Auto LP Recovery
- 07: Auto Counter
- 08: Japanese for "Status effect ability change disabled"
- 09: Japanese for "Support attack rate up"
- 0A: Japanese for "Makes it easier to obtain certain kinds of rocks"
- 0B: Japanese for "Increased movement speed"
- 0C: Japanese for "Can overcome obstacles"

The "Japanese for" ones are, of course, unused. The exception is 08, which I have found on OP Frigi, and
is presumably why he gets no support effects.

0x62 is then some value associated with that Ability (0x63 is probably also technically part of the value,
but it's always 00 so who cares). We thus are in need of another table for those:
- Nothing: Always 00
- FP Plus: (+Percent + 100) / 10
- Parting Blow: Percent / 10
- Auto LP Recovery: Percent
- Auto Counter: Since it is always 0x64 here, this is most likely the chance to trigger
- Frigi's 08: The value is 01 for some unknown reason

Over at 0x6C is the multiplier for the damage between an AZ vivo and an SZ vivo. Unusually for Fossil
Fighters, this value is the multiplier times 100, not times 10. For example, the default one is
0x32 -> 50 -> 0.5.

0x70 is the multiplier for the damage between two SZs vivos; this is relevant for e.g. moves that hit all
enemeis. Like with 0x6C, this value is the multiplier times 100; for example, the default one is
0x28 -> 40 -> 0.4.

0x84 represents what Number a vivo has, which is just their ID (except for postgame Frigi and Igno). 0x88
is what position a vivo is at when you sort by alphabetical order (which is related since you can sort by
Number).

Now we finally come to the normal four (or three) skill IDs. These are from 0x8C to 0x9B. Directly after that
are 1, 2, 3, 4 each as four byte numbers. Both of these show off an important property of FF1: if a vivosaur
has three moves, the fourth move's ID bytes and 04 00 00 00 literally just don't exist. This means you have
to be careful when using any offsets given after this point on, say, Zino (for simplicity they will be given
for four-movers). Also, if this isn't clear, the IDs are the moves' chunk numbers in attack_defs.

From 0xAC to 0xB3 are a vivosaur's support effects. The first four bytes are for your AZ, and the second four
are for theirs. The stats go in order: Attack, Defense, Accuracy, and then Evasion. Also, if you see some
weirdly high number thats way more than 100, then that's actually a negative support effect. So just use
(256 - the number) to get what it really is. Ironically, unlike in FFC the support effects exist and are all
00's if the vivo has none.

0xB4 to 0xBD are really the highlight of FF1's creature_defs for me. You see, as you may know, Dinomaton is
immune to all statuses except confusion. In order to implement this, despite Dinomation having no other
Ability, they felt the need to give every single vivosaur a value for their chance to actually recieve
every single status that hit them. That's right folks, almost all the vivosaurs you look at will have ten
64's here, just so Dinomation (and OP Frigi and Igno) can resist statuses. The order of those statuses are
the order of the Primary Statuses over in the attack_defs documentation.

0xC0 to 0xC3 are another set of 1, 2, 3, 4, with each being one byte each. Vivosaurs with three moves have a
00 instead of a 04, but are not missing it entirely this time. I believe that this controls move order,
while the long ones control which fossils you learn a move at. My evidence for this is that the Chickens
have all 1's in the long section (since they learn all their moves with their "first" egg fossil), but
have the usual 1-2-3-4 in this short section.

Finally, like with FFC, the last 24 bytes of a chunk is devoted to the health of a vivosaur at each Rank,
1 through 12. Specifically, thats offsets 0xC4 to DB.

So after all that, maybe you still want to give someone a fourth move. Well, I actually glossed over quite a
few things you will need to change in order to make that happen:
- 0x28: Number of moves
- 0x38: Number of moves
- 0x3C: Location of beginning of first 1, 2, 3, 4 (the long one) in the chunk
- 0x54: Location of first ally support effect (A4 for 3-movers, AC for 4-movers)
- 0x58: Location of first enemy support effect
- 0x68: Location of beginning of status chances
- 0x74: Number of moves
- 0x78: Location of beginning of second 1, 2, 3, 4 (the short one)
- 0x80: Location of the beginning of the health data
Along with, to be clear, the main stuff you need to insert--four bytes of move ID after 0x97, and
04 00 00 00 after what is now 0xA7--and changing the 00 at what is now 0xC3 to 04.
Good luck!

Also, due to not being mechanically significant (unlike their counterparts in FFC), a vivosaur's Class and
Diet are not definied within these chunks.
