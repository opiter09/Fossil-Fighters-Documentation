EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

The first four bytes are just the ID of the move. Then 0x04-0x07 is the number of "hits" a move has.
That is, it says how many separate damage values will appear on screen if you let the animation play out.

0x08 is a pointer to where the damage of the first hit begins, while 0x0C is a pointer to where the
total damage begins (see below). Then 0x10 is a pointer to the beginning of the Primary Status data,
and 0x14 is a pointer to the beginning of the Secondary Status data (see further below).

0x1C tells you whether a move is "counter proof" or not. It is 00 if the move cannot be countered, and
03 if it can.

The damage and cost of a move begin at 0x20, but where it ends depends on how many "hits" the move has.
For each hit, you get four bytes--two of FP, and two of damage. After all these, you get two bytes of
total FP (the actual FP cost of the move) and total damage (base, so Wiki Damage - Wiki Attack Stat).
As a result of this, the locations of values below may be later than what is listed, since the listed
locations are for one-hit moves. Also, what happens if you try to use values that do not add up is
currently unknown.

To make a move have --- and deal no damage, literally set the damage values to 0.

Note: all locations shown below are for single-hit moves; add to them for multihit moves as appropriate.

The Primary Status (the one that has an icon in the in-battle stats menu) is much less hardcoded than in
FFC, taking up 0x28-0x2D (six bytes). The first byte is the effect, the second is the chance for it to hit,
the third is how many turns it lasts, the fourth is its icon, and the fifth and sixth are values whose
meaning depends on the effect. Note that changing this does not in any way change the moves' descriptions;
there is one hardcoded description for each move (in text/japanese).

Here is the table for Primary Status effects:
- 01: Nothing
- 02: Poison
- 03: Sleep
- 04: Scare
- 05: Excite
- 06: Confusion
- 07: Enrage
- 08: Counter
- 09: Enflame
- 0A: Harden
- 0B: Quicken

The icons go in order, with Normal Poison being 02, then Gold Poison being 03, then Normal Sleep being
04, etc. Nothing moves have a turn count of 00, and an icon of 01.

As stated previously, the values in 0x2C-0x2D have context-dependent meanings. So here is another table for
them:
- Nothing: 01 00
- Poison: Percent of max LP damaged, then 00
- Sleep: 00 00
- Scare: Number of moves made unusable, then 00
- Excite: 00 00
- Confusion: 00 00
- Enrage: Amount Attack is raised, then amount Accuracy is lowered
- Counter: Percent chance a move will be countered, then 00
- Enflame: Amount Attack is raised, then amount Defense is lowered
- Harden: Amount Defense is raised, then 00
- Quicken: Amount Evasion is raised, then 00

Next up is what I call the Secondary Status (the non-icon effects), which take up much less space. The ID
is at 0x30, then the percent to it, and then immediately after we have the secondary value (which can be
assumed to be a single two-byte number).

Here is another table for Secondary IDs:
- 01: Nothing
- 02: Transformation
- 03: All-zone attack
- 04: Steal LP equal to damage
- 05: Steal FP
- 06: Spite Blast
- 07: Power Scale
- 08: Knock to EZ
- 09: Unused, based on FFC it heals youself only
- 0A: Heal whole team
- 0B: Sacrifice
- 0C: Law of the Jungle
- 0D: Heal one ally
- 0E: Unused, based on FFC it heals one other ally only
- 0F: Cure all statuses
- 10: Swap Zones

And here is a table for secondary values:
- Nothing: 00 00
- Transformation: 01 00
- All-Zone Attack: 00 00
- Steal LP: 00 00
- Steal FP: Amount of FP to steal
- Spite Blast: Amount of damage dealt
- Power Scale: 00 00
- Knock to EZ: 00 00
- Unused 09: Presumably the healing amount
- Heal whole team: The healing amount
- Sacrifice: 00 00
- Law of the Jungle: 00 00
- Healing one ally: The healing amount
- Unused 0E: Presumably the healing amount
- Cure all Statuses: 00 00
- Swap Zones: 00 00

If this is a transforming move, after the Secondary value you have one byte of "number of vivosaurs you
can transform into", then 00 00 00 0C 00 00 00, then the vivosaur IDs you can transform into (still one
byte each).

Finally, moves may have extra 00's at the end. This is because moves are another one of those things that
need to have a multiple of 4 bytes in their chunk. So, if you add or remove bytes, make sure to add or
remove 00's according (but I would advise that if you would have no 00's at all, put in four instead).
