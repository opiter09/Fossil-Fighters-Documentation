EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

The Map folder is split into five sub-folders:
	- c's use is unknown, but speculated to involve the Camera
	- e sets out the various Excavation zones in each digsite
	- m defines various parameters for the map, along with saying which vivosaurs can be found in each numbered zone
	- r contains all NPCs, loading zones, etc.

Within them, all files are numbered, according to map ID. Unlike FF1, no-one has worked out all the map IDs. However, thanks to the pictures mentioned below, you
should be able to get a good idea which is which.

All the folders except m are of the type GRD, i.e. "grid." Thus, if you remove the first 20 bytes of the file, then set HxD to display a number of bytes per row equal to
bytes 4-8, you end up with a picture of the map telling you where everything is. For excavation, specifically, "FFC-E-Maps-Color.zip" in this folder shows renditions of that
made using Python.

M is a little different, and its full purpose has not yet been divined. However, for fossils specifically, the following set-up is known:
- At 0x6C to 0x6F, there is a pointer
- At that pointer, there is a list of pointers, the number of which can be found at 0x68-0x6B
- Each of that list goes to a fossil table. All information about it will be given in relative addresses:
	- The zone the table is for is at 0x02, probably. Or, I mean, it could just be an indexing thing, but I doubt it
	- The number of vivosaur entries is given at 0x0C. This also serves as the number of pointers coming up (all of which are relative to the beginning of this
      particular fossil table). Every table I've looked at has three such pointers, but because the value for where they start is at 0x10, I feel pretty confident that
	  they would be next to each other
	- Thus, like I said, the location of the beginning of those pointers can be found at 0x10-0x13. It seems to be consistently 0x1C, but I probably just haven't
	  found the weird ones yet
	- Heading there, each pointer is four bytes. Unlike FF1, the differences between them actually vary
	- After that, we finally get the vivosaur "entries," which actually are themselves tables. These go by fossil ID, thus allowing for the head-only vivosaurs.
	- They also get their own headers? Like, what the fuck, man. We're up to like triple-relative here, but here goes (starting from the pointer):
		- 0x0C-0x0F is some sort of pointer to something in here. The main thing to know is that if this value is not 0x14, you need to adjust the locations below
		  accordingly.
		- 0x18-0x1B is the maximum number of spawns of this zone that can occur in this map (as far as I can tell, it just always spawns this many, but I don't want
		  to just say that)
		- 0x1C-0x1F is how many weird gigantic numbers that increment we get starting at 0x2C, while the amount of space they take up is also at 0x20-0x23.
		  However, these values seem to be constant, so one or both of them might really be something else
		- Then, at 0x24-0x27, we get how many actual fossil entries there are (usually, but I can't guarantee this, starting at 0x40)
		- Each fossil entry is 8 bytes long:
			- The first byte is for being a dark fossil (01 = no, 02 = yes)
			- The second byte is for being rare (again, 01 = no, 02 = yes)
			- The third and fourth bytes are the fossil ID
			- The fifth and sixth bytes are the spawn chance. It is not out of 100, because that would make sense. Instead, it is out of the total of all of these
			  values in a single table. So, uh, keep a calculator handy I guess
			- The seventh and eight bytes are the % chance that it will make you fight a random fighter
It appears that FFC is known to lock fossils behind sonar upgrades like FF1, so that is a handy explanation for the whole "everything has three tables" situation.
Also, if you find ridiculously tiny tables, it's because those zones aren't actually used on the map (as you can see in the FFC-E-Maps-Color files).

If you find all that confusing, not to fear. There is a file named "FFC Digsites.txt" in this folder that dumps all that data from every digsite. Additionally, the
Python source code is provided, if that helps you understand it better.
