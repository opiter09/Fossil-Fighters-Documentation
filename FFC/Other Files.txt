EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

etc/btl_kp_defs controls how much FP you have per hero level. Each row's 0x?C is the level number, then
the next row's 0x?0-0x?1 are the max FP recharge, and that row's 0x?2-0x?3 and 0x?6-0x?7 are the recharge
per turn. Or, put another way, starting at 0x0C each level has a 16-byte chunk, with bytes 4-5 being the
max recharge, and bytes 6-7 and 10-11 being the recharge per turn. Presumably, one of these is for you,
and the other is for enemies. Or not, I don't know, because they're always the same in vanilla.


This one is certainly a mouthful: etc/creature_evolution_abilityup_param_defs controls the stat boosts of
Gold and Silver fossils. The first 16 bytes are a header thing, then each set of 12 bytes are the fossil's
data: two bytes for ID, two bytes for Health boost, two bytes for Attack boost, two bytes for Defense boost,
two bytes for Accuracy boost, and two bytes for Speed boost. All values are what you get if the fossil is
cleaned to a full 100 points. In terms of order, it starts with the Gold fossil, then the Silver Head, then
the Body, then the Arms, and finally the Legs.


etc/donate_kaseki_defs defines each of the fossils you can buy using Donation Points. Each fossil has an
8-byte chunk, with the first one starting at 0x1C. The chunk's first two bytes are the fossil ID, then the
next two bytes are its DP cost. The next three bytes are flags (i.e. always 0 or 1). These almost match up
to whether the rock is Dark or not, but for some reason in Vanilla the non-Dark legs have all three set
to one, the same as the Dark fossils. However, it is known that if you set the first two to 0 and the
third to 1, it is guaranteed not to be Dark.


etc/creature_palet_defs defines each of the Silver Fossil color sets. Starting from 0x0C, each ID is
12 bytes long, consisting of two bytes of incrementing index, two bytes of the palette, and then
two bytes each for the seldom-used Red, Green, and Blue modifiers. The default for those is, as you'll
quickly notice, 0x64. See also:

etc/horider_experience_defs controls how much XP each quest gives. The first 16 bytes are the header,
then we have four bytes per quest: two of ID, and two of XP amount. Currently, which quest is which
is unknown, and cannot be easily derived from this file alone.
