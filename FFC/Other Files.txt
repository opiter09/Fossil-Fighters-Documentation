EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

etc/btl_kp_defs controls how much FP you have per hero level. Each row's 0x?C is the level number, then
the next row's 0x?0-0x?1 are the max FP recharge, and that row's 0x?2-0x?3 and 0x?6-0x?7 are the recharge
per turn. Or, put another way, starting at 0x0C each level has a 16-byte chunk, with bytes 5-6 being the
max recharge, and bytes 7-8 and 11-12 being the recharge per turn. Presumably, one of these is for you,
and the other is for enemies. Or not, I don't know, because they're always the same in vanilla.

This one is certainly a mouthful: etc/creature_evolution_abilityup_param_defs controls the stat boosts of
Gold and Silver fossils. The first 16 bytes are a header thing, then each set of 12 bytes are the fossil's
data: two bytes for ID, two bytes for Health boost, two bytes for Attack boost, two bytes for Defense boost,
two bytes for Accuracy boost, and two bytes for Speed boost. All values are what you get if the fossil is
cleaned to a full 100 points. In terms of order, it starts with the Gold fossil, then the Silver Head, then
the Body, then the Arms, and finally the Legs.

etc/donate_kaseki_defs defines each of the fossils you can buy using Donation Points. Each fossil has an
8-byte chunk, with the first one starting at 0x1C. The chunk's first two bytes are the fossil ID, then the
next two bytes are its DP cost. The next three bytes are flags (i.e. always 0 or 1). These almost match up
to whether the rock is Dark or not, but for some reason in Vanilla the non-Dark legs have all three set
to one, the same as the Dark fossils. However, it is known that if you set the first two to 0 and the
third to 1, it is guaranteed not to be Dark.

etc/creature_palet_defs defines each of the Silver Fossil color sets. Starting from 0x0C, each ID is
12 bytes long, consisting of two bytes of incrementing index, two bytes of the palette, and then
two bytes each for the seldom-used Red, Green, and Blue modifiers. The default for those is, as you'll
quickly notice, 0x64. See also:

etc/horider_experience_defs controls how much XP each quest gives. The first 16 bytes are the header,
then we have four bytes per quest: two of ID, and two of XP amount. Currently, which quest is which
is unknown, and cannot be easily derived from this file alone.

episode/e0012 controls the four starters Joe gives you to pick from. Each starter has its ID at
three locations; it is unknown what each does individually, but just edit them all and you'll be
fine. Specifically, the starter locations are:
- Aeros: 0x1B28, 0x1B48, 0x1B60
- Toba: 0x1DD8, 0x1DF8, 0x1E10
- Tsintao: 0x2088, 0x20A8, 0x20C0
- Dimetro: 0x2338, 0x2358, 0x2370

episode/e0022 controls the Tricera tutorial fossil and revival. Like in FF1, the fossil and
vivosaur are separate, but only in a cosmetic sense. However, unlike in FF1, legendaries et al.
have no fossils at all, so you cannot use them for this. The fossil value is at 0x1780, while the
vivosaur ID value is at 0x1C74 for success, and 0x244C for failure (see ffc_vivoNames.txt for the
values, since the internal IDs and external Numbers are occasionally mismatched for unknown reasons).
Also, to be clear, the failure vivo is not cosmetic, that actually determines what you get (and
you could, if you really wanted to, make that one into a special vivo and it would work).

Do note that, as with all things, editing the data for the starters or Tricera does not change the
relevant text. Fortunately, FFC has an easy naming scheme here, so you can just edit msg/msg_0012 and
msg/msg_0022. Unfortunately, Carbonizer can be (at time of writing) rather finicky with FFC, so before
running it you will need to open up the file "config.json" in Notepad and replace the 9th line with
the following line exactly:
	"fileTypes": ["DMG", "DTX", "MAR", "NDS"],

Interestingly, the first Pacro Head you dig up in the tutorial is not simply fetched from Treasure
Lake's spawn table, but instead stored inside episode/e0023, at location 0x2C84. Therefore, if
you plan on editing Treasure Lake's spawns, you most likely will want to also edit this to match.
