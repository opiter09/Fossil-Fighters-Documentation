EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

A vivosaur's element is at 0x01. 01 is Fire, 02 is Air, 03 is Earth, 04 is Water, 05 is Neutral, and
06 is Legendary.

For the main four stats, each gets four bytes starting at 0x02. The first byte is some sort of growth rate,
seemingly always from 01 to 04. Then we have the Rank 10 value, then the Rank 1 value, and then the Rank
20 value. The order is the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy, and Speed.

Crit rate is always at 0x12, and reduplicated at 0x13 for some reason. Link chance is at 0x14; both
are out of 100.

A vivosaur's Diet is at 0x15, although do note that that portion of its Fossilary entry is controlled
by a separate text file (text/text_museum). 01 is Carnivore, 02 is Herbivore, 03 is Omnivore, and 04 is
Unknown.

A vivosaur's Era is at 0x16 (same deal about the Fossilary Entry though). Interestingly, the values go
backwards through time:
- 01: No Time Period
- 02: Cenozoic Quaternary
- 03: Cenozoic Neogene
- 04: Cenozoic Paleogene
- 05: Mesozoic Creataceous
- 06: Mesozoic Jurassic
- 07: Mesozoic Triassic
- 08: Paleozoic Permian
- 09: Paleozoic Carboniferous
- 0A: Paleozoic Devonian
- 0B = Paleozoic Ordovician
- 0C = Paleozoic Cambrian

0x17 is the vivosaur's position when you sort by LP. This is entirely separate from the actual LP
values, because of course it is.

0x18 is theoretically the vivosaur's digsite for Fossilary ordering purposes. Like the Eras above, this
list is backwards and does not affect the text, but it also seems to skip a value (0x0C), so here's a table:
- 01: Bonus data (and the debugs)
- 02: Zongazonga rematch
- 03: Lola fight
- 04: Lester fight
- 05: Cole fight
- 06: Robinson fight
- 07: Side mission
- 08: Super revival
- 09: Donation Points vivosaur
- 0A: Seabed Cavern
- 0B: BB Brigade Base
- 0C: Unused
- 0D: The Bonehemoth
- 0E: Icegrip Plateau
- 0F: Hot Spring Heights
- 10: Dusty Dunes
- 11: Rainbow Canyon
- 12: Mt. Krakanak
- 13: Petrified Woods
- 14: Stone Pyramid
- 15: Jungle Labyrinth
- 16: Treasure Lake
However, changing this value alone does not work, for reasons currently unknown.

A vivosaur's Range is at 0x1A, with 01 being Close-Range, 02 being Mid-Range, and 03 being Long-Range.
Again, the text for this is stored separately, in text/text_dino_kind.

Strangely, the range multipliers are not stored somewhere else per class, but are spelled out for each
vivo, at 0x1B-0x2B. Only the first 8 seem to be used (with the rest being 00) and each value is the
multiplier percentage. As for which values go where, well we have determined that you can only be 1-7
tiles alway from another vivo, and the first two values here are always the same, ergo, we can assume
that these go from 0 through 7 tiles away. Regarding calculating distance, Megalo-vania puts it like
this: "The black line [between the two closest AZs] represents 1 tile away // then you move up or down
on your side to get 2 tiles // then up or down on the opponents side to get 3 tiles // and so on // the
backlines attacking each other make for 7 tiles of distance // then you go back down again"

A vivosaur's static/blue move is at 0x19. Link is not one of them; you just have Link by having a
non-zero chance. Here's the table for this:
- 01: Nothing
- 02: Japanese for "View enemy details during battle"
- 03: Japanese for "Dinosaur placement randomization"
- 04: FP Plus
- 05: Parting Blow
- 06: Auto LP Recovery
- 07: Auto Counter
- 08: Japanese for "Status effect ability change disabled"
- 09: Japanese for "Support attack rate up"
- 0A: Japanese for "Makes it easier to obtain certain kinds of rocks"
- 0B: Japanese for "Increased movement speed"
- 0C: Japanese for "Can overcome obstacles"
- 0D: Elemental Boost
- 0E: Position Lock
- 0F: FP Absorb
- 10: Solo Power
- 11: Berserker
- 12: Enter with a Status
- 13: Japanese for "Increased damage against specific attributes"
- 14: Resurrect

The "Japanese for" effects are, of course, unused, and they also seem to not do what they say, or indeed
anything at all. Some may have only worked on debug builds, while others may only have worked in
FF1 (looking at you, 09).

0x23 to 0x2A are a series of "flag" bytes that determine immunity--01 means the vivo is immune to that
status and will never receive it, and 00 means it is not. The order of statuses roughy corresponds to
the orders found in Attack_Defs, but with the Silver and Gold versions combined together:
- Poison
- Sleep
- Scare
- Enrage
- Confusion
- Excite
- Infection
- Instant KO

0x30 to 0x31 is the vivosaur's name text (from text/text_dino_short_name). 0x34 to 0x35 represent a
vivo's ID Number, the thing you see in the top left of their VMM page. 0x36 to 0x37 is the ID of the
vivosaur this one super evolves into, while 0x38 to 0x39 is the ID of the vivosaur it super evolves from (both
are 0 if not applicable). If you want to change this, make sure to edit ALL related into/from values together.
0x3A to 0x3B is the vivosaur's model (presumably from inside of model/arcdin, but I can't seem to find their
index files). 0x40 to 0x41 controls both the vivosaur's medal sprite (from motion/ui_reviver_medal/reviver_NNN_XX)
and its battle sprite (from motion/battle_creature/creature_NNN_XX).

0x42 to 0x43 controls what EchoSpaceZ calls the "animation pack"--it defines, for all four moves together,
the particle effects, camera positions, and how many damage values are shown (but see 0x08 of attack_defs for
how many damage values a move has internally). The one thing this does not change is how the motions of the
vivosaur itself, which is instead tied to the model.

Note that this whole set of values from 0x2C to 0x43 match up with the vivosaurs' internal IDs (i.e. the
number in the chunk file name), except for the ID Number value (since there are cases where that does not
match the internal ID), and of course who the vivosaur revives into/from. Oh and the debugs are also weird,
since except for their ID Number they use the value of the vivosaur they are based on, which in turn means
that the vivosaurs after them use their internal ID minus 6 for their animation pack and a few other values.

0x46 to 0x4D represent the color IDs for a vivosaur's head, body, arm, and legs Silver Fossil
recolorings (two bytes each). You can match these up to etc/creature_palet_defs to get the palette and
RGB values. See also:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tZV5rMJejwdMHK2A3DZOAHsNPo-BfDxqWt6Ce4esaY/edit#gid=0

0x4E to 0x4F is the move ID of the Team Skill. All skill IDs can be found by looking at the
number at the end of their file in vivoFiles, or their line number in FFC files' vivoNames.txt (both of
which are in my Chunk Editor).

0x50 to 0x51 are always the same value as that vivosaur's first move in vanilla, and has been shown to be the
move a vivosaur uses with Link. Since Link always skips move animations in FFC, you can put anything you
want in here without fear of it looking weird.

0x56 is the vivosaur's position when you sort by alphabetical order. If you ever decide to change a
vivosaur's name (say, by sacrificing a Debug to make a Brain), make sure to change this accordingly.

For effects which have one, 0x54 represents the ability's corresponding Value. It is inconsistent enough
that another table is in order:
- Nothing: Always 00
- FP Plus: (+Percent + 100) / 10
- Parting Blow: Percent / 10
- Auto LP Recovery: Percent
- Auto Counter: Since it is always 0x64 here, this is most likely the chance to trigger
- Elemental Boost: Always 00
- Position Lock: Always 00
- FP Absorb: Percent of incoming move's FP cost gained
- Solo Power: Always 00
- Berserker: This is the only ability where 0x55 may be something other than 00, since this is what move
  Hopter always uses when woozy. By default, it is E7 01, i.e. Beak Stab.
- Enter with a Status: This represents the ID of the status. It matches up perfectly with the "primary"
  effect table given below.
- Resurrect: Z-Rex has a 02 here, even though this ability activates after three turns. However, this is
  similar to how Infection has a 04 despite it taking 5 turns to kill (see below), so we can safely say
  that this controls how many turns it takes to come back.

WARNING: If you give a vivosaur Start with a Status using a status that does not have a move name at the
end of text/text_ui, that vivosaur will show a completely tetxless blue box when you view its stats
anywhere. The statuses that have move names are the regular and Gold ("S") versions of Enflame, Harden,
Quicken, and Counter, along with Gold Sleep (for Nigo's "Sleepy").

The team compatibility of a vivosaur can be found from 0x5C to 0x5F. It is stored not in hex, but in
binary, with each 1 of this 32-bit integer denoting a team it is in, and each 0 denoting a team it is
not in. When converting, do not swap the bytes around or anything, type them in exactly as you see them
(i.e. big-endian), and also remember to add zeroes at the beginning of the result if the first byte(s) are
00 (since programs usually leave those off). Here is the table for groups (it's very long, feel free to
skip over it):
1: Group 8
2: Group 7
3: Group 6 (Violent)
4: Group 5 (Neutral-types)
5: Group 4 (Water-Types)
6: Group 3 (Earth-Types)
7: Group 2 (Air-Types)
8: Group 1 (Fire-Types)
9: Group 16 (Japanese)
10: Group 15
11: Group 14
12: Group 13
13: Group 12
14: Group 11
15: Group 10
16: Group 9
17: Group 24
18: Group 23 (Zombie)
19: Group 22 (Boney)
20: Group 21
21: Group 20

23: Group 18
24: Group 17
25: Unused "Group 32"
26: Group 31
27: Group 30 (Dinaurians)
28: Group 29
29: Group 28
30: Group 27
31: Group 26

[each pre-colon number is in decimal, and is which bit from the left controls that group]

Note: these Groups come from the Wiki. See
https://fossilfighters.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Compatible_Vivosaurs for more information.

0x98 to 0x9B is a pointer to where the vivosaur's list of moves begins. You shouldn't ever need to
change this, but it's still good to know. Similarly, 0xA0 to 0xA3 is a pointer to where the vivosaur's
list of move-learning levels begins.

0xA4 to 0xAB tells you what side the vivosaur's support effects apply to. CC 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
means your side, 00 00 00 00 CC 00 00 00 means their side, and all zeroes means the vivosaur has no
support effects at all. Why CC? Tonzilla was able to help me figure that one out: it is a pointer to the
beginning of the support effects block. So if you happen to be editing Tonzilla and add whatever it is he
is missing, then make sure to change the C4 in this area to CC.

0xBC to 0xC3 are the move IDs of the normal four (or three) moves, each two bytes. Do note that if a
vivosaur in FFC has only three moves, they will have a 00 00 here, so you don't have to worry about
adjusting locations based on that.

0xC4 to 0xCB are the levels each move is learned at (two bytes each). Again, missing moves have a 00 00,
it's really nice.

Rank 20 support effects can be found at 0xCC to 0xCF. They go in the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy,
and Speed order, and each are one byte. For negative effects, the support % equals 255 - number + 1.
Vivosaurs with no support effects at all simply have four less bytes in their chunk.

After support effects if they are there is usually 01 02 03 04, for the four moves. Missing moves also get
a 00 here.

A vivosaur's health for each level takes up the last 40 bytes of a chunk. Obviously, each health amount is
thus two bytes each (for Ranks 1 to 20).

Okay, time for a nice roundup on how to add a move:
- Change the 00 00 at 0xC2-0xC3 to the move ID
- Change the 01 02 03 00 after the support effects (or at 0xCC itself if there are none) to 01 02 03 04
- Change the number of moves from 03 to 04 at 0x94, 0x9C, and 0xAC
- Change the 00 00 at 0xCA to 07 00 (or whatever level you want the move to unlock at)
And... that should be it! no bytes are added or deleted, nice and easy.

However, since support effects hate me here, let's write out what you need to change to add them in entirely:
- Add in the actual support effects, after 0xCB (or before wherever the 01 02 03 04 is)
- Change 0xA4 to CC (or wherever you put the support effects) if you want them to affect your team,
  or change 0xA8 to CC if you want them to affect the enemy
- Add 4 to the values at 0xB0 and 0xB8 (the pointers to the 01 02 03 04 block and the 20 LP values,
  respectively)
Oh, that's it, huh. Good thing these are near the end I guess.
