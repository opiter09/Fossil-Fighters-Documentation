EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

A vivosaur's element is at 0x01. 01 is Fire, 02 is Air, 03 is Earth, 04 is Water, 05 is Neutral, and
06 is Legendary.

For the main four stats, each gets four bytes starting at 0x02. The first byte is some sort of growth rate,
seemingly always from 01 to 04. Then we have the Rank 10 value, then the Rank 1 value, and then the Rank
20 value. The order is the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy, and Speed.

Crit rate is always at 0x12, and reduplicated at 0x13 for some reason. Link chance is at 0x14; both
are out of 100.

A vivosaur's Diet is at 0x15, although do note that that portion of its Fossilary entry is controlled
by a separate text file (text/text_museum). 01 is Carnivore, 02 is Herbivore, 03 is Omnivore, and 04 is
Unknown.

A vivosaur's Era is at 0x16 (same deal about the Fossilary Entry though). Interestingly, the values go
backwards through time:
- 01: No Time Period
- 02: Cenozoic Quaternary
- 03: Cenozoic Neogene
- 04: Cenozoic Paleogene
- 05: Mesozoic Creataceous
- 06: Mesozoic Jurassic
- 07: Mesozoic Triassic
- 08: Paleozoic Permian
- 09: Paleozoic Carboniferous
- 0A: Paleozoic Devonian
- 0B = Paleozoic Ordovician
- 0C = Paleozoic Cambrian

A vivosaur's Range is at 0x1A, with 01 being Close-Range, 02 being Mid-Range, and 03 being Long-Range.

A vivosaur's static/blue move is at 0x19. Link is not one of them; you just have Link by having a
non-zero chance. Here's the table for this:
- 01: nothing
- 02: Japanese for "View enemy details during battle"
- 03: Japanese for "Dinosaur placement randomization"
- 04: FP Plus
- 05: Parting Blow
- 06: Auto LP Recovery
- 07: Auto Counter
- 08: Japanese for "Status effect ability change disabled"
- 09: Japanese for "Support attack rate up"
- 0A: Japanese for "Makes it easier to obtain certain kinds of rocks"
- 0B: Japanese for "Increased movement speed"
- 0C: Japanese for "Can overcome obstacles"
- 0D: Elemental Boost
- 0E: Position Lock
- 0F: FP Absorb
- 10: Solo Power
- 11: Berserker
- 12: Enter with a Status
- 13: Japanese for "Increased damage against specific attributes"
- 14: Resurrect

The "Japanese for" effects are, of course, unused, and they also seem to not do what they say, or indeed
anything at all. Some may have only worked on debug builds, while others may only have worked in
FF1 (looking at you, 09).

0x23 to 0x2B are a series of "flag" bytes that determine immunity--01 means the vivo is immune to that
status and will never receive it, and 00 means it is not. The order of statuses roughy corresponds to
the orders found in Attack_Defs, but with the Silver and Gold versions combined together:
- Poison
- Sleep
- Scare
- Enrage
- Confusion
- Excite
- Infection
- Venom
- ????? (Always 00 in vanilla)

0x4E to 0x4F is the move ID of the Team Skill. All skill IDs can be found by looking at the
number at the end of their file in vivoFiles, or their line number in FFC files' vivoNames.txt (both of
which are in my Chunk Editor).

0x50 to 0x51 are always the same value as that vivosaur's first move in vanilla, and has been shown to be the
move a vivosaur uses with Link. Since Link always skips move animations in FFC, you can put anything you
want in here without fear of it looking weird.

For effects which have one, 0x54 represents the ability's corresponding Value. It is inconsistent enough
that another table is in order:
- nothing: Always 00
- FP Plus: (+Percent + 100) / 10
- Parting Blow: Percent / 10
- Auto LP Recovery: Percent
- Auto Counter: Since it is always 0x64 here, this is most likely the chance to trigger
- Elemental Boost: Always 00
- Position Lock: Always 00
- FP Absorb: Percent of incoming move's FP cost gained
- Solo Power: Always 00
- Berserker: This is the only ability where 0x55 may be something other than 00, since this is what move
  Hopter always uses when woozy. By default, it is E7 01, i.e. Beak Stab.
- Enter with a Status: This represents the ID of the status. It matches up perfectly with the "primary"
  effect table given below.
- Resurrect: Z-Rex has a 02 here, even though this ability activates after three turns. However, this is
  similar to how Infection has a 04 despite it taking 5 turns to kill (see below), so we can safely say
  that this controls how many turns it takes to come back.

WARNING: If you give a vivosaur Start with a Status using a status that does not have a move name at the
end of text/text_ui, that vivosaur will show a completely tetxless blue box when you view its stats
anywhere. The statuses that have move names are the regular and Gold ("S") versions of Enflame, Harden,
Quicken, and Counter, along with Gold Sleep (for Nigo's "Sleepy").

0x56 is the position the vivosaur is at when sorting alphabetically. That seems random, but it probably
made going from Japanese to English way easier.

The team compatibility of a vivosaur can be found from 0x5C to 0x5F. It is stored not in hex, but in
binary, with each 1 of this 32-bit integer denoting a team it is in, and each 0 denoting a team it is
not in. When converting, do not swap the bytes around or anything, type them in exactly as you see them
(i.e. big-endian), and also remember to add zeroes at the beginning of the result if the first byte(s) are
00 (since programs usually leave those off). Here is the table for groups (it's very long, feel free to
skip over it):
1: Group 8
2: Group 7
3: Group 6 (Violent)
4: Group 5 (Neutral-types)
5: Group 4 (Water-Types)
6: Group 3 (Earth-Types)
7: Group 2 (Air-Types)
8: Group 1 (Fire-Types)
9: Group 16 (Japanese)
10: Group 15
11: Group 14
12: Group 13
13: Group 12
14: Group 11
15: Group 10
16: Group 9
17: Group 24
18: Group 23 (Zombie)
19: Group 22 (Boney)
20: Group 21
21: Group 20
22: Group 19
23: Group 18
24: Group 17
25: Unused "Group 32"
26: Group 31
27: Group 30 (Dinaurians)
28: Group 29
29: Group 28
30: Group 27
31: Group 26
32: Group 25
[each pre-colon number is in decimal, and is which bit from the left controls that group]

Note: these Groups come from the Wiki. See
https://fossilfighters.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Compatible_Vivosaurs for more information.

0xA4 to 0xAB tells you what side the vivosaur's support effects apply to. CC 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
means your side, 00 00 00 00 CC 00 00 00 means their side, and all zeroes means the vivosaur has no
support effects at all. Why CC? Tonzilla was able to help me figure that one out: it is a pointer to the
beginning of the support effects block. So if you happen to be editing Tonzilla and add whatever it is he
is missing, then make sure to change the C4 in this area to CC.

0xBC to 0xC3 are the move IDs of the normal four (or three) moves, each two bytes. Do note that if a
vivosaur in FFC has only three moves, they will have a 00 00 here, so you don't have to worry about
adjusting locations based on that.

0xC4 to 0xCB are the levels each move is learned at (two bytes each).

Rank 20 support effects can be found at 0xCC to 0xCF. They go in the usual Attack, Defense, Accuracy,
and Speed order, and each are one byte. For negative effects, the support % equals 255 - number + 1.
Vivosaurs with no support effects at all simply have four less bytes in their chunk, and what is here is
how many moves a vivo has.

On that point: after support effects if they are there is usually 01 02 03 04. This means that a vivosaur
has four non-team skills. For vivosaurs like Cheirus with only three, there is 01 02 03 00 there instead.

That block mostly seems redundant to me, especially since 0x94, 0x9C, AND 0xAC also contain the number of
moves (so make sure to change all of these when appropriate). However, it is important for one thing and
one thing only: the beginning and ending bytes of this block are pointed to at 0xB0 and 0xB8, respectively.
You HAVE to change these if you want to add or remove support effects entirely, i.e. when you add or
delete bytes.

A vivosaur's health for each level takes up the last 40 bytes of a chunk. Obviously, each health amount is
thus two bytes each (for Ranks 1 to 20).

Final word of warning: as with all things, if the file size is different (looking at you, Tonzilla), make
sure to change my locations accordingly. Every value from vanilla should be known, so just look for it.
