EVERYTHING IS LITTLE-ENDIAN

The first two bytes of a chunk represent what I call the Primary Status, the thing that actually has an
icon in the game. If you change this, the icon near the move will change, but not the description text
(you can edit that in text/text_attack_info and text/text_attack_information). The first byte is the
status ID, while the second is the percent to trigger.

The table for this can be found below:
- 01: nothing
- 02: Normal Poison
- 03: Gold Poison
- 04: Venom (U-Raptor)
- 05: Normal Sleep
- 06: Gold Sleep
- 07: Normal Scare
- 08: Gold Scare
- 09: Normal Enrage
- 0A: Gold Enrage
- 0B: Normal Confusion
- 0C: Gold Confusion
- 0D: Normal Excite
- 0E: Gold Excite
- 0F: Counter (Percent is for whether it is applied, 70% chance to counter is hardcoded)
- 10: Super Counter (Percent is for whether it is applied, 100% chance to counter is hardcoded)
- 11: Enflame
- 12: Super Enflame
- 13: Harden
- 14: Super Harden
- 15: Quicken
- 16: Super Quicken
- 17: Charge
- 18: Super Charge (unused)

If a move is "counter proof," the third byte of its chunk will be 0x00. If not, that byte will be 0x03.

0x08 tells you how many "hits" a move has. That is, it says how many separate damage values will appear
on screen if you let the animation play out.

0x0C is a pointer to where the damage of the first hit begins, while 0x10 is a pointer to where the
total damage begins (see below). 0x14 is then a pointer to where the Secondary Status data begins (see
further below).

The damage and cost of a move begin at 0x18, but where it ends depends on how many "hits" the move has.
For each hit, you get four bytes--two of FP, and two of damage. After all these, you get two bytes of
total FP (the actual FP cost of the move) and total damage (base, so Wiki Damage - Wiki Attack Stat).
As a result of this, the locations of values below may be later than what is listed, since the listed
locations are for one-hit moves. Also, what happens if you try to use values that do not add up is
currently unknown.

To make a move have --- and deal no damage, literally set the damage values to 0.

Note: all locations shown below are for single-hit moves; add to them for multihit moves as appropriate.

The values for what I call the Secondary Status--so healing, FP steal, etc., really any effect that does
not have an icon--can be found at 0x20 to 0x21. Again, the first byte is the ID, and the second is the
percent to hit.

Here is the table for those:
- 01: nothing (everything is 00)
- 02: Transformation (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is always 01 00)
- 03: All-zone attack (always 0%, bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value. Can hit your team if
  used with a support effect like Harden, and can actually deal damage unlike with single-targeting.)
- 04: Steal LP equal to damage (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 05: Steal FP (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is stealing amount)
- 06: Spite Blast (bytes after pecent are 07 00, extra value is damage amount)
- 07: Power Scale (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 08: Rotate (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 09: Unused, it heals youself only (bytes after percent are unknown, extra value is healing amount)
- 0A: Heal whole team (bytes after pecent are 05 00, extra value is healing amount)
- 0B: Sacrifice (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 0C: Law of the Jungle (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 0D: Heal one ally (bytes after percent are 01 00, extra value is healing amount)
- 0E: Unused, it heals one other ally only (bytes after percent are unknown, extra value is healing amount)
- 0F: Cure all statuses (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 10: Unused, it's Rotate except it deals no damage even with a damage value assigned (bytes after percent
  are unknown, no extra value). This may be how Slippery Ice is implemented.
- 11: Randomly attack enemy team (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 12: Infection (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is 04 00, and since the wiki says it's
  five turns to death I wager this controls that)
- 13: Heal and cure statuses (bytes after percent are 01 00, extra value is healing amount)
- 14: Heal and cure statuses for whole team (bytes after percent are 05 00, extra value is healing amount)
- 15: Fickle Goddess [boost a stat randomly] (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 16: Inflict effects randomly (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)
- 17: Instant KO (bytes after percent are 07 00, extra value is percent chance to work)
- 18: Cure all statuses for the whole team (bytes after percent are 07 00, no extra value)

For transforming moves, 0x28 is the number of possible vivos to transform into. Then vivosaur IDs start
at 0x30 and are each one byte. Once again, ID = vivoFiles file number.

WARNING: For certain vivosaurs that are palette swaps of other ones [e.g. T-Rex Lord and Mapo King], the
wrong model and sprite may be shown when you Transform into them. This has no effect on gameplay since the
moves are all correct; this is just a cosmetic issue. It is believed that this is caused by transformation
ignoring Silver Fossil recolorings, and such super evolvers being all internally considered recolors
of the same model.

Moves with an Extra Value, like healing, have theirs on the third and fourth bytes after the percent,
as a two-byter. If there is no value, it's just 00 00 there. What exactly the Bytes After Percent do
is currently unknown, so just stick with the numbers I pulled from vanilla moves.
