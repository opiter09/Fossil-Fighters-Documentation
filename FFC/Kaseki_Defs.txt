This file determines the data for the various fossils. For you see, "kaseki" is Japanese for
"fossil."

0x08 is the part of the fossil: 01 = Head, 02 = Body, 03 = Arms, 04 = Legs, and 05 = Single
(Egg, Curious, etc.).

0x0E-0x0F is the ID of the image used by the fossil. This ID corresponds to the name of certain files
inside the image folder, namely ones that begin with "kaseki." The format is kaseki_*ID*_XXX. Within that
ID, there is itself a logic, in that the 0YY's are heads, the 1YY's are bodies, the 2YY's are arms,
the 3YY's are legs, etc.

0x10 is the ID of the vivosaur this fossil matches up with. Every vivosaur needs to be matched to
no fossils, one of all four parts, or a Single one, or the game will break.

0x12-0x13 is the ID of the image used by the rock. This ID corresponds to the name of certain files
inside the image folder, namely ones that begin with "chips." The format is chips_*ID*_XXX.

0x1C-0x1F is the buying price of the fossil, while 0x20-0x23 is the selling price.
